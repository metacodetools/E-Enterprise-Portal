 * @{
 * Functions for Drupal's Ajax framework.
 *
 * Drupal's Ajax framework is used to dynamically update parts of a page's HTML
 * based on data from the server. Upon a specified event, such as a button
 * click, a callback function is triggered which performs server-side logic and
 * may return updated markup, which is then replaced on-the-fly with no page
 * refresh necessary.
 *
 * This framework creates a PHP macro language that allows the server to
 * instruct JavaScript to perform actions on the client browser. When using
 * forms, it can be used with the #ajax property.
 * The #ajax property can be used to bind events to the Ajax framework. By
 * default, #ajax uses 'system/ajax' as its path for submission and thus calls
 * ajax_form_callback() and a defined #ajax['callback'] function.
 * However, you may optionally specify a different path to request or a
 * different callback function to invoke, which can return updated HTML or can
 * also return a richer set of
 * @link ajax_commands Ajax framework commands @endlink.
 *
 * Standard form handling is as follows:
 *   - A form element has a #ajax property that includes #ajax['callback'] and
 *     omits #ajax['path']. See below about using #ajax['path'] to implement
 *     advanced use-cases that require something other than standard form
 *     handling.
 *   - On the specified element, Ajax processing is triggered by a change to
 *     that element.
 *   - The browser submits an HTTP POST request to the 'system/ajax' Drupal
 *     path.
 *   - The menu page callback for 'system/ajax', ajax_form_callback(), calls
 *     drupal_process_form() to process the form submission and rebuild the
 *     form if necessary. The form is processed in much the same way as if it
 *     were submitted without Ajax, with the same #process functions and
 *     validation and submission handlers called in either case, making it easy
 *     to create Ajax-enabled forms that degrade gracefully when JavaScript is
 *     disabled.
 *   - After form processing is complete, ajax_form_callback() calls the
 *     function named by #ajax['callback'], which returns the form element that
 *     has been updated and needs to be returned to the browser, or
 *     alternatively, an array of custom Ajax commands.
 *   - The page delivery callback for 'system/ajax', ajax_deliver(), renders the
 *     element returned by #ajax['callback'], and returns the JSON string
 *     created by ajax_render() to the browser.
 *   - The browser unserializes the returned JSON string into an array of
 *     command objects and executes each command, resulting in the old page
 *     content within and including the HTML element specified by
 *     #ajax['wrapper'] being replaced by the new content returned by
 *     #ajax['callback'], using a JavaScript animation effect specified by
 *     #ajax['effect'].
 *
 * A simple example of basic Ajax use from the
 * @link http://drupal.org/project/examples Examples module @endlink follows:
 * @code
 * function main_page() {
 *   return drupal_get_form('ajax_example_simplest');
 * }
 *
 * function ajax_example_simplest($form, &$form_state) {
 *   $form = array();
 *   $form['changethis'] = array(
 *     '#type' => 'select',
 *     '#options' => array(
 *       'one' => 'one',
 *       'two' => 'two',
 *       'three' => 'three',
 *     ),
 *     '#ajax' => array(
 *       'callback' => 'ajax_example_simplest_callback',
 *       'wrapper' => 'replace_textfield_div',
 *      ),
 *   );

 *   // This entire form element will be replaced with an updated value.
 *   $form['replace_textfield'] = array(
 *     '#type' => 'textfield',
 *     '#title' => t("The default value will be changed"),
 *     '#description' => t("Say something about why you chose") . "'" .
 *       (!empty($form_state['values']['changethis'])
 *       ? $form_state['values']['changethis'] : t("Not changed yet")) . "'",
 *     '#prefix' => '<div id="replace_textfield_div">',
 *     '#suffix' => '</div>',
 *   );
 *   return $form;
 * }
 *
 * function ajax_example_simplest_callback($form, $form_state) {
 *   // The form has already been submitted and updated. We can return the replaced
 *   // item as it is.
 *   return $form['replace_textfield'];
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * In the above example, the 'changethis' element is Ajax-enabled. The default
 * #ajax['event'] is 'change', so when the 'changethis' element changes,
 * an Ajax call is made. The form is submitted and reprocessed, and then the
 * callback is called. In this case, the form has been automatically
 * built changing $form['replace_textfield']['#description'], so the callback
 * just returns that part of the form.
 *
 * To implement Ajax handling in a form, add '#ajax' to the form
 * definition of a field. That field will trigger an Ajax event when it is
 * clicked (or changed, depending on the kind of field). #ajax supports
 * the following parameters (either 'path' or 'callback' is required at least):
 * - #ajax['callback']: The callback to invoke to handle the server side of the
 *   Ajax event, which will receive a $form and $form_state as arguments, and
 *   returns a renderable array (most often a form or form fragment), an HTML
 *   string, or an array of Ajax commands. If returning a renderable array or
 *   a string, the value will replace the original element named in
 *   #ajax['wrapper'], and
 *   theme_status_messages()
 *   will be prepended to that
 *   element. (If the status messages are not wanted, return an array
 *   of Ajax commands instead.)
 *   #ajax['wrapper']. If an array of Ajax commands is returned, it will be
 *   executed by the calling code.
 * - #ajax['path']: The menu path to use for the request. This is often omitted
 *   and the default is used. This path should map
 *   to a menu page callback that returns data using ajax_render(). Defaults to
 *   'system/ajax', which invokes ajax_form_callback(), eventually calling
 *   the function named in #ajax['callback']. If you use a custom
 *   path, you must set up the menu entry and handle the entire callback in your
 *   own code.
 * - #ajax['wrapper']: The CSS ID of the area to be replaced by the content
 *   returned by the #ajax['callback'] function. The content returned from
 *   the callback will replace the entire element named by #ajax['wrapper'].
 *   The wrapper is usually created using #prefix and #suffix properties in the
 *   form. Note that this is the wrapper ID, not a CSS selector. So to replace
 *   the element referred to by the CSS selector #some-selector on the page,
 *   use #ajax['wrapper'] = 'some-selector', not '#some-selector'.
 * - #ajax['effect']: The jQuery effect to use when placing the new HTML.
 *   Defaults to no effect. Valid options are 'none', 'slide', or 'fade'.
 * - #ajax['speed']: The effect speed to use. Defaults to 'slow'. May be
 *   'slow', 'fast' or a number in milliseconds which represents the length
 *   of time the effect should run.
 * - #ajax['event']: The JavaScript event to respond to. This is normally
 *   selected automatically for the type of form widget being used, and
 *   is only needed if you need to override the default behavior.
 * - #ajax['prevent']: A JavaScript event to prevent when 'event' is triggered.
 *   Defaults to 'click' for #ajax on #type 'submit', 'button', and
 *   'image_button'. Multiple events may be specified separated by spaces.
 *   For example, when binding #ajax behaviors to form buttons, pressing the
 *   ENTER key within a textfield triggers the 'click' event of the form's first
 *   submit button. Triggering Ajax in this situation leads to problems, like
 *   breaking autocomplete textfields. Because of that, Ajax behaviors are bound
 *   to the 'mousedown' event on form buttons by default. However, binding to
 *   'mousedown' rather than 'click' means that it is possible to trigger a
 *   click by pressing the mouse, holding the mouse button down until the Ajax
 *   request is complete and the button is re-enabled, and then releasing the
 *   mouse button. For this case, 'prevent' can be set to 'click', so an
 *   additional event handler is bound to prevent such a click from triggering a
 *   non-Ajax form submission. This also prevents a textfield's ENTER press
 *   triggering a button's non-Ajax form submission behavior.
 * - #ajax['method']: The jQuery method to use to place the new HTML.
 *   Defaults to 'replaceWith'. May be: 'replaceWith', 'append', 'prepend',
 *   'before', 'after', or 'html'. See the
 *   @link http://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/ jQuery manipulators documentation @endlink
 *   for more information on these methods.
 * - #ajax['progress']: Choose either a throbber or progress bar that is
 *   displayed while awaiting a response from the callback, and add an optional
 *   message. Possible keys: 'type', 'message', 'url', 'interval'.
 *   More information is available in the
 *   @link forms_api_reference.html Form API Reference @endlink
 *
 * In addition to using Form API for doing in-form modification, Ajax may be
 * enabled by adding classes to buttons and links. By adding the 'use-ajax'
 * class to a link, the link will be loaded via an Ajax call. When using this
 * method, the href of the link can contain '/nojs/' as part of the path. When
 * the Ajax framework makes the request, it will convert this to '/ajax/'.
 * The server is then able to easily tell if this request was made through an
 * actual Ajax request or in a degraded state, and respond appropriately.
 *
 * Similarly, submit buttons can be given the class 'use-ajax-submit'. The
 * form will then be submitted via Ajax to the path specified in the #action.
 * Like the ajax-submit class above, this path will have '/nojs/' replaced with
 * '/ajax/' so that the submit handler can tell if the form was submitted
 * in a degraded state or not.
 *
 * When responding to Ajax requests, the server should do what it needs to do
 * for that request, then create a commands array. This commands array will
 * be converted to a JSON object and returned to the client, which will then
 * iterate over the array and process it like a macro language.
 *
 * Each command item is an associative array which will be converted to a
 * command object on the JavaScript side. $command_item['command'] is the type
 * of command, e.g. 'alert' or 'replace', and will correspond to a method in the
 * Drupal.ajax[command] space. The command array may contain any other data that
 * the command needs to process, e.g. 'method', 'selector', 'settings', etc.
 *
 * Commands are usually created with a couple of helper functions, so they
 * look like this:
 * @code
 *   $commands = array();
 *   // Replace the content of '#object-1' on the page with 'some html here'.
 *   $commands[] = ajax_command_replace('#object-1', 'some html here');
 *   // Add a visual "changed" marker to the '#object-1' element.
 *   $commands[] = ajax_command_changed('#object-1');
 *   // Menu 'page callback' and #ajax['callback'] functions are supposed to
 *   // return render arrays. If returning an Ajax commands array, it must be
 *   // encapsulated in a render array structure.
 *   return array('#type' => 'ajax', '#commands' => $commands);
 * @endcode
 *
 * When returning an Ajax command array, it is often useful to have
 * status messages rendered along with other tasks in the command array.
 * In that case the Ajax commands array may be constructed like this:
 * @code
 *   $commands = array();
 *   $commands[] = ajax_command_replace(NULL, $output);
 *   $commands[] = ajax_command_prepend(NULL, theme('status_messages'));
 *   return array('#type' => 'ajax', '#commands' => $commands);
 * @endcode
 *
 * See @link ajax_commands Ajax framework commands @endlink
